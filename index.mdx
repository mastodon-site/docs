Mastodon.site is a free-to-use mastodon instance that everyone's welcome to join - you can see us at [social.mastodon.site](https://social.mastodon.site).

We also help people run their own mastodon instance if they want to take control of their social media - perfect for businesses, social groups, or just individual users:

You can always start small and upgrade to a larger instance over time, if you need to ([more details on how we price](/managed-instance)).

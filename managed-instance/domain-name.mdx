## Customise your social media presence with your domain

A custom domain name is a great way to claim your identity online - and mastodon usernames work just like email addresses.

Whether you want to be `john@smith.com`, `lois.lane@daily.planet` or `sam@london.football`, you can show who you are, who you work for, or what you're into. Your only limit is finding the right domain name.

## Bring your own domain

Although we don't register domain names for you, we give you all of the info you need to point a domain you have registered elsewhere to us to run your instance. A few minutes is all it takes.
